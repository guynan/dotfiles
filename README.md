# Dotfiles

This is an aggregate for all the files that pertain to my current/past setup(s) on Unix-like operating systems.

All files in the directory are designed to be placed in $HOME/.config/ except those in 'bsd' and 'root' which follow a directory style placement. 

My current means for keeping this updated with my latest copies of my files is by cloning this into a directory and symbolically linking the files from that directory to their respective locations.

I am thinking of writing a script that removes all the hard work out of setting up a new OS that implements the symbolic links required to get it working.

It is pretty sloppy and the commits are all over the place because my mood is always changing but clone it anyway to make me feel good.
