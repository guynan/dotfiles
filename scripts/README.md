# Scripts

These scripts are designed to be able to return the most frequently used config files and directories to how they are supposed to be. The recommended way for using them is to:
```
	cd /usr/local/src/
	git clone https://www.github.com/guynan/dotfiles.git
	cd dotfiles/scripts
	./home-setup
	./restore
```
